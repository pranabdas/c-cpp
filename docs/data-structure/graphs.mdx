title: Graphs

Graphs are everywhere around us: computer networks, road networks, social
networks, electronic circuits, molecular structure etc.

**Terminology:**

$G = (V, E)$

$V \Rightarrow \text{Vertices}$

$E \Rightarrow \text{Edges} \subseteq V \times V$

Edges can be directed or undirected. Say we have two vertices $v$ and $w$.
Possible Edges could be $e = (w, v)$ or $e' = (v, w)$. In case of undirected
edges, $e = \{v, w\}$. We will use the set notation where order does not matter.

In case of undirected graph, number of edges:

$$
|E| \le \binom{|V|/2}{2} = \mathcal{O}(|V|^2)
$$

If we have directed graph, there will be factor of 2, still
$\mathcal{O}(|V|^2)$.

### Graph representation

How can we store a graph in the computer? Few of the options are:
- Edge list
- Adjacency list
- Adjacency matrix

**Adjacency matrix:** say we have a graph $G = (V, E)$ with $n$ vertices and $m$
edges. We can represent $G$ using and $n \times n$ matrix $M$, where element
$M[i, j] = 1$ if $(i, j)$ is an edge of $G$, and $0$ if it is not an edge. This
representation allows faster look up, and updates for edge insertion and
deletion. However, it may use excessive space for sparse graphs.

**Adjacency list:** We can more efficiently store sparse graphs by using linked
lists to store neighbors of each vertex.

**Sparse vs. dense:** usually sparse graphs number of edges
$|E| \approx \mathcal{O}(|V|)$, while for dense graphs
$|E| \approx \mathcal{O}(|V|^2)$.

### Path
$p = (v_1, v_2, \dots, v_k)$ where
$(v_i, v_{i+1}) \in E~\forall~i \in \{1, 2, \dots, k-1\}$.

$l(p) \Rightarrow \text{length}$

$\delta(p) \Rightarrow \text {length of shortest path}$
