Computers spend a lot of time sorting while processing data. Once sorting is
done, many other problems becomes very easy. It is also one of the most studied
problem in computer science. Many of the interesting ideas such as
dive-and-conquer, randomized algorithms, lower bounds etc. can be found in the
context of sorting. Here we will look into some of the sorting algorithms and
how they scales with increasing problem size.

### Permutation sort

Given an array, we create all possible permutations of the array items, then
check if the one of those permutations are sorted. This algorithm is extremely
inefficient, there are $n!$ possible permutations of $n$ items. Even for a
relatively small number of input size 20, $(20)! \approx 2 \times 10^{18}$. For
each step, we also need about $\mathcal{O}(n)$ checks to find out if one of the
permutations is sorted.

### Selection sort

Here is how the selection sort works: say we are given the following array to
sort: [5, 8, 2, 3, 7, 9]

**Step 1:** find the biggest element in first (n - 1) element and swap it with
the last element if it is bigger than the last element else do nothing

**Step 2:** find biggest element in first (n - 2) element, and swap it with
(n-1)th element if it is bigger

Below is an implementation in C++.

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import selection_sort from '!!raw-loader!/src/cpp/misc/selection_sort.cpp';

<CodeBlock language="cpp" title="src/cpp/misc/selection_sort.cpp" showLineNumbers>{selection_sort}</CodeBlock>

### Insertion sort

import insertion_sort from '!!raw-loader!/src/cpp/misc/insertion_sort.cpp';

<CodeBlock language="cpp" title="src/cpp/misc/insertion_sort.cpp" showLineNumbers>{insertion_sort}</CodeBlock>

Both selection sort and insertion sort has time complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$.

### Merge sort

import merge_sort from '!!raw-loader!/src/cpp/misc/merge_sort.cpp';

<CodeBlock language="cpp" title="src/cpp/misc/merge_sort.cpp" showLineNumbers>{merge_sort}</CodeBlock>

Merge sort has time complexity $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$. Note that for any
comparison model, there are $n!$ possible outcomes for a problem size $n$.
Minimum height of such as descision tree would be $\log(n!) \approx n \log n$.
Therefore, merge sort is best possible (or close to best possible) solution for
any sorting algorithm based on comparison model. Can we do better?

### Linear sort

It takes constant amount of time to access a memory location (RAM) by its
address. If we are able to build a direct access array (DAA), we can get its
elements by its index. We can build key value pairs, where keys are index of an
DAA. If we have to search through the array, we can get an item in constant
time. Say we have $n$ items and the key space is $u$. If $n$ and $u$ are of the
same order, then such an algorithm would be efficient. Example: say we have
student IDs (keys) based on their ranking.

What if key space is of the order of $n^2$? In that case, we can break down each
key in a tuple of (a, b), where `a = u / n` (integer division), and `b = u % n`
(remainder of modulo division). Example: say we have a list of 5 numbers:
{12, 17, 3, 22, 24}, we can transform them into {(2, 2), (3, 2), (0, 3), (4,2),
(4, 4)}. Now, if we need to sort them (we can call tuple sort), we need to sort
first based on the least significant tuple digit (here second digit), and we
obtain: {(2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (0, 3), (4, 4)}. Finally, we sort by the most
significant tuple digit: {(0, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 4)}.

:::info

Note that we need a stable sorting algorithm to sort above tuple, i.e., it
maintains the order of numbers in the original input list. If the input tuple
was {(2, 3), (2, 1)} after sorting based on most significant tuple digit (i.e.,
first digit), it should return {(2, 3), (2, 1)}.
