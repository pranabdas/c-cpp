I will be using GNU C Compiler (GCC) to compile codes in a Linux computer. You
can install GCC in Ubuntu/Debian by:

```bash
apt install gcc
```

Command to compile:
```bash
gcc filename.c

# linking math lib
gcc filename.c -lm

# show all compiler warnings
gcc -Wall filename.c

g++ filename.cpp

# compile with specific standard (might require for latest language features)
g++ -std=c++17 filename.cpp
g++ -std=c++2a filename.cpp
```

This would produce executable with default name `a.out`. You can specify the
executable name by using the `-o` flag:
```bash
gcc filename.c -o program_name
```

For complex programs, you can use `-g` flag to generate debugging information.
`-O` flag can be used to optimize the executable file (`-O2`, `-O3` denotes
various levels of optimization).

Compiler (GCC/Clang) flags for warnings: `-Wall`, `-Wextra`, `-Wpedantic`,
`-Wunused`.

### Makefile

For large/complex projects with multiple source/header files and might require
linking various various libraries, unix makefile is very helpful to write the
compilation rules and build the program. Here is a very simple example:

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import makefile from '!!raw-loader!/src/cpp/basics/Makefile';

<CodeBlock language="makefile" title="src/cpp/basics/Makefile" showLineNumbers>{makefile}</CodeBlock>

A makefile is consists of a set of rules. A rule consists of a target, a list of
prerequisites, and a command. In the above example, we have several rules:
`all`, `hello`, `hello.o`, and `clean`. In case of `all`, we have prerequisite
`hello`, while there is no command. In case of `hello`, prerequisite is `hello.o`
and rule is: `${CC} -o hello hello.o` and so on. If we run `make` without any
argument, the first rule will run, which is in this case `all`. We can run
another rule, we can run it by providing its name, e.g., `make clean`. Later we
will see use of more complex makefile.

### Debugging

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install gdb
```

We can use `gdb` to debug our program. We can embeed debugging information to
our code by using `-g` or `-g3` flag. It might be helpful also to disable
optimizations with `-O0` while debugging. We compile the program:

```bash
gcc -g -O0 -Wall filename.c -o filename.o
```

Using `gdb`:
```bash
gdb filename.o
```

**Useful gdb commands:**

Commands                     | Description
---------------------------- | -----------
break/b `line-number`        | create breakpoint at specific line
break `filename:line-number` | create breakpoint at specific line and file
run/r                        | run program
c                            | continue execution
next                         | execute next line
step/s                       | execute next line or step into function
quit/q                       | quit gdb
print expression             | print current value of a specified expression
help [command]               | in-program help
bt                           | print the stack trace
clear `line-number`          | clear break point
clear `filename:line-number` | clear break point in a specific file and line
info/i break/b               | list all break points
del `breakpoint Num`         | delete a break point
del `start-br-pt`-`end-br-pt`| delete break points from `start-breakpoint-Num` to `end-breakpoint-Num`

### Cppcheck

Sometimes I will be using `cppcheck` to debug codes as well.

```bash
apt install cppcheck
cppcheck --enable=all filename.cpp
```

### Valgrind

Install valgrind in Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
apt install valgrind
```

Valgrind is a memory profiling tool (includes memcheck, cachegrind, callgrind,
etc). First compile your program with debug flag:
```bash
gcc -g filename.c
```

```bash
valgrind ./a.out
valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes --show-reachable=yes --num-callers=20 --track-fds=yes ./a.out
```

Valgrind can also detect:
- invalid pointer use
- use of uninitialized variables
- double frees

Valgrind does not check bounds on statically allocated arrays.
