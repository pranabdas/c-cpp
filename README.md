# Programming in C and C++

Learning C and C++ languages.

Compile:
```console
gcc filename.c
```
This would produce executable with default name `a.out`. You can specify the
executable name by using the `-o` flag:
```console
gcc filename.c -o program.o
```

**Warning:** Certain codes are compiler dependent, and may throw errors.
